<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
This project focused on developing a <strong>real-time bimanual teleoperation system</strong> where two
<strong>Interbotix RX200 robotic arms</strong> are coordinated using a
<strong>Geomagic Touch haptic device</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The system enables a <strong>leader-mimic configuration</strong> in which one robot follows the operator’s motion
while the second robot mirrors the motion in a synchronized and safe manner.
The goal was to achieve smooth, low-latency, coordinated dual-arm manipulation
for cooperative tasks such as object handling.
</p>

<li>Ensures safe execution using IK validation</li>
<li>Minimizes delay for precise small-scale movements</li>
</ul>

<p>
Relevant to applications in <strong>space robotics, surgical robotics, and cooperative manipulation</strong>.

<h2>4.1 Approach</h2>

<p>
With the help of the Teleoperation node created in Chapter 3, Bimanual robot
control is to be achieved. For this bimanual control, two RX200 interbotix robots are used.
I thought of creating a mimic node which makes the robot(robot2) mimic the leader
robot(robot1). I tried creating it but the delay is very high. When the leader robot moves
the mimic robot is taking 1-2 seconds to move. The delay of 2 seconds is not at all good.
So, to reduce the delay I created two teleoperation nodes for two robots. With this, the
data from the geomatic touch is processed separately by each node. With this the time
taken for data processing and robot movement will be same for both robots. This is very
crucial in bimanual robot control. Let’s call robot1 as Leader and robot2 as Mimic. Both
the teleoperation nodes have the same code but some small changes in code
differentiates between Leader and Mimic. I have to create a logic such that the Mimic
robot mirrors the movements of Leader robot. In simple words, when the leader robot
moves to the right, the mimic robot should move to the left.
Before achieving this, I should make sure the two robot’s workspace coincides. Because
only when the workspace coincides, the robots can hold the object. I have to make sure
that the coincided workspace is maximum and the robots should not collide with each
other.

<h3>Robot Placement</h3>

<p>
The robot should be placed in such a way that the coincided robot workspace is
maximum. For this I placed the Robots facing each other with a distance of 0.58m. For
achieving this in simulation I launched leader robot with Rviz and Mimic robot without
Rviz. In the leader robot’s Rviz, I added RobotModel and changed the topic to mimic
robot. Now, the leader robot and mimic robot will coincide each other. To make them face
each other i used ros_tf2_static_transform. With static_transform I made the mimic robot
move 0.58m in X-direction and rotate along Z-axis by 3.14 radians. This makes the Mimic
robot move apart from leader robot and face each other.
</p>

<h3>Collision Avoidance</h3>

<p>
The second task is to make sure the robots does not collide with each other. To
make this I made a logic such that when the x > 0.24 the x = 0.24. With the robots will not
collide because the robots are displaced by 0.58m they can come to half the distance
that is 0.24 but should not exceed that. If it exceeds 0.24 since the robots are 0.58 meters
aways the grippers collide each other. With this Logic collision problem is solved.
</p>

<h3>Delay Reduction</h3>

<p>
The major improvements I have implemented in bimanual control was delay
reduction. Low latency is crucial in teleoperation. The latency should be very less to use
geomagic touch for precise manipulation. If the system introduces a delay, any small
movement in stylus results in robot responding after lag, making it difficult to perform
smooth action. To execute fine movements, the user would have to move the stylus
slightly and then wait for the robot to react before giving the next input. This is
undesirable. By reducing the delay, I significantly improved the system’s responsiveness
and enabling real time control on robotic arm.
</p>

<h3>Real-Time Pose Execution</h3>

<p>
In the teleoperation system that I have developed, real time pose execution is
crucial. The pose data from geomagic touch is streamed at high frequency and used to
continuously update the end effector position of RX200 robot. To prevent system
overload and ensure stable performance, a frequency limiter is implemented, allowing
pose updates for every 20 milliseconds (50 hz). This ensures the system process input
data fast enough for smooth control.
</p>

<h3>Mutual Validation and Safety Enforcement</h3>

<p>
A key component of bimanual control in mutual validation mechanism, which
ensures the robotic arms operate in synchronized manner. When the system enter leader-
mimic mode (triggered by grey button), the leader arm makes a movement only if the
mimic arm confirm a valid IK. This is done with the help of ROS2 topics named as
/pose_valid_leader and /pose_valid_mimic. The /pose_valid_leader is used to publish the
leader’s state and the /pose_valid_mimic for receiving mimic’s status. This gating
mechanism prevents undesirable movement. When one arm fails to compute valid IK, the
other arm will not make a movement, thus safeguarding shared object manipulation.
