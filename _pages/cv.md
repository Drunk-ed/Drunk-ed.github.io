## Experience
<hr>

### Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad (On-Site)  
*Summer Intern (Full-time; Advisor: Prof. Ameer Mulla)*  
**May 2025 – July 2025**

- **Teleoperation Pipeline Development:** Developed a ROS 2-based teleoperation pipeline to control an Interbotix RX200 robot using Geomagic Touch input, converting Cartesian pose data into joint-space commands via inverse kinematics with joint-limit enforcement.  
- **Bimanual Control System:** Engineered a bimanual control framework where a secondary RX200 mirrors the leader’s end-effector pose using real-time TF transformations and synchronized execution.  
- **Mutual Gating and Safety Logic:** Implemented mutual motion gating using ROS 2 Bool topics and planning validity checks to ensure coordinated and safe dual-arm behavior.
