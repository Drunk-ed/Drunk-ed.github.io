<!-- Project Overview -->
<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Phantom_to_Interbotix_teleop</strong> is a ROS 2-based teleoperation
framework enabling <strong>real-time, intuitive control</strong> of an
<strong>Interbotix RX200 robotic arm</strong> using a
<strong>Geomagic Touch haptic device</strong>.</p>

<p>The project maps human hand motions to precise robot movements for natural
end-effector control.</p>

<p>Useful in robotics research and human-in-the-loop applications.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Approach:</h2>

<h3>Geomagic Touch:</h3>
<p>To use Geomagic Touch, Openhaptics and Touch device Drivers are needed. These
drivers are available at 3D Systems website. After successful installation of Haptic drivers the
Geomagic touch publish data in 5 Topics. They are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/phantom/button:</strong> It publishes the state of the buttons on the Geomagic touch stylus pen.</li>

<li><strong>/phantom/force_feedback:</strong> The topic /phantom/force typically publishes the force vector
measured or rendered at the end-effector (stylus tip) of the Geomagic Touch / SensAble
Phantom haptic device.</li>

<li><strong>/phantom/joint_states:</strong> This topic publishes the Joint position of the Geomagic touch. It has 6
joints Waist, Shoulder, Elbow, Yaw, Pitch and Roll.</li>

<li><strong>/phantom/pose:</strong> This topic publishes the X, Y, Z coordinates of the Stylus pointer and Quaternion
which gives the pitch yaw and roll after conversion.</li>

<li><strong>/phantom/state:</strong> This topic publishes the complete state of the Geomagic Touch. This message
provides a high-level snapshot of the device in a single package:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Processing:</h3>
<p>The data from the Geomagic touch should be processed before feeding it to the robot.
This process should be carried out because the Origin of the stylus pointer is not the Table i.e. (0,
0, 0) it is at (0.00, 0.08, 0.06). So, a homogenous Transformation matrix is created the Geomagic
coordinates into World coordinates. After converting the coordinates into world frame the values
are fed to the IK Solver of Geomagic Touch.</p>

<p>The Geomagic touch is 6 DoF and the RX200 is 5 DoF which means the yaw motion of
Geomagic touch should be neglected. But here is the caught Geomagic touch will not directly
give pitch, yaw and roll. It gives out this data in the form of a quaternion. By converting the
quaternion, we can get pitch, yaw and roll. If we force the yaw to 0 the output will not be
accurate. Because the pitch and roll are given with respect to yaw. So make this accurate I used
the /phantom/joint_states to get the joint positions of pitch and roll joints. This actually helped</p>

me to get accurate pitch and roll. So, in the data processing the XYZ is taken from
/phantom/pose, Button state from /phantom/button and orientation (pitch, roll) from
/phantom/joint_states.</p>

<h3>IK Solver:</h3>
<p>The XYZ coordinates obtained from the input device (such as the Geomagic Touch) are
passed to the robot's Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver using the function set_ee_pose_components ().
This function takes the desired end-effector position in 3D space specified by the X, Y, and Z
values along with optional orientation parameters such as roll, pitch, and yaw.</p>

<p>The IK solver processes these coordinates and computes the corresponding joint angles
required to move the robot's arm to the target position. Once the joint angles are determined, the
robot's internal motion controller executes the movement, causing the arm to physically reach
the specified position in space.</p>

<h3>Gripper Control:</h3>
<p>For effective usage of gripper, I have created a method using the /phantom/button topic. I used
grey button for gripper control. When the state of grey button is True the gripper will grasp and
when the grey button state is False then the gripper will release. So, to hold an object one need to
press and hold the grey button. This is done by using gripper.grasp and gripper.release functions
of interbotix manipulator package.</p>

<h3>Button Configuration:</h3>
<p>I first configured the White button for orientation. When white button is pressed then the pitch
and roll of the robot can be changed. I have defined the Pose_Callback function such that when
no button is pressed, we can manipulate the robot with XYZ coordinates but the roll and pitch of
the robot will remain unchanged. When white button is pressed the XYZ coordinates will remain
unchanged but we can control the orientation of the wrist. After getting the correct orientation,
release the white button and press and hold the grey button to hold the object. After releasing
the grey button, the gripper is released and the orientation of the wrist will go to zero and it goes
to XYZ manipulation mode.</p>

<h3>Workspace Expansion:</h3>
<p>As the Geomagic workspace is very small, the workspace of the robotic arm is also limited. To
reach the object the object which is in the RX200 workspace but not in Geomagic workspace is
not possible. This is undesirable because the RX200 robot can reach the object but because of
using Geomagic coordinates it could’nt reach the goal position. To overcome this, I multiplied the
Geomagic coordinates with 2 which increased the workspace by 2 times.</p>
